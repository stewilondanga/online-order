## Description
when the site ( https://stewilondanga.github.io/online-order/ ) is loaded a validation form is loaded

the form has specific details required for submitting an online order and all fields are required in order for data to be 
submitted

However there is no database linked so the submit button is inactive but the check box before the button displays status of the
form upon reaching that data entry point
